## Features

### Comprehensive Storage Calculation
- Estimate storage requirements based on:
  - Number of objects and average object size
  - Vector dimensions and quantization methods
  - **Inverted Indexes**: Factors for filterable and searchable property storage, with defaults derived from real-world dataset analysis.
- Supports all Weaviate quantization methods:
  - **None** (32-bit float)
  - **Scalar Quantization (SQ)**
  - **Product Quantization (PQ)**
  - **Residual Quantization (RQ)**
  - **Binary Quantization (BQ)**
- Provides a detailed breakdown of storage components:
  - Raw Object Storage
  - Vector (HNSW) Index Storage
  - Filterable Properties Index Storage
  - Searchable Properties (BM25) Index Storage

### Extrapolation from Sample Data
- Predict storage requirements for larger datasets based on a sample from your existing Weaviate instance.
- Supports both **linear** and **conservative** extrapolation models to account for growth overhead.

### Interactive Visualizations
- Detailed bar charts showing the full breakdown of storage components.
- Side-by-side comparison of different quantization methods.

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your browser.
2.  Navigate between the tabs:
    -   **ðŸ“Š Parameter-Based Calculation**: Input your data characteristics to get a detailed storage breakdown. Adjust inverted index factors in the sidebar for fine-tuning.
    -   **ðŸ“ˆ Extrapolate from Dataset**: Use metrics from your current dataset to project future storage needs.
3.  Use the "Clear All & Reset" button in the sidebar to reset all fields to their default values.

## Notes on Compression Methods

-   **Scalar Quantization (SQ)**: Reduces vector size by ~75% with minimal quality loss.
-   **Product Quantization (PQ)**: Segments vectors and compresses them for significant storage savings.
-   **Residual Quantization (RQ)**: An advanced form of PQ, often providing better accuracy for a similar storage footprint.
-   **Binary Quantization (BQ)**: Compresses vectors to 1 bit per dimension, offering the highest compression at the cost of accuracy.
