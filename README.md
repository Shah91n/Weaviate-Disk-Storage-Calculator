## Features

### Parameter-Based Storage Calculation
- Estimate storage requirements based on:
  - Number of objects
  - Vector dimensions
  - Average object size
  - Vector quantization methods
- Supports different quantization methods:
  - **None** (32-bit float)
  - **Scalar Quantization (SQ)**
  - **Product Quantization (PQ)**
  - **Binary Quantization (BQ)**
- Provides a detailed breakdown of storage components:
  - Raw object storage
  - Vector storage
  - Searchable properties storage

### Compression Comparison
- Compare storage savings and quality impact of different quantization methods
- Visualize storage requirements for each method

### Extrapolation from Sample Data
- Predict storage requirements for larger datasets based on a sample dataset
- Supports both **linear** and **sublinear** extrapolation models

### Interactive Visualizations
- Storage breakdown charts
- Compression comparison charts
- Extrapolation projection charts

## Notes on Compression Methods

- **Scalar Quantization (SQ)**: Reduces vector size by 75% with minimal quality loss (~5%)
- **Product Quantization (PQ)**: Segments vectors into 8-bit integers for efficient storage
- **Binary Quantization (BQ)**: Compresses vectors to 1 bit per dimension, offering the highest compression but with significant accuracy trade-offs
